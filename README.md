# PixPro

Unofficial implementation of the code in: [Propagate Yourself: Exploring Pixel-Level Consistency for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10043).

## Current Status

Implementations of the dataloader and model are presumably complete. Still requires a training script and then the results for PASCAL and COCO need to be reproduced.
